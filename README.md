ROBOFRIENDS

This is a project that I had learnt alongside my Complete Web Developer in 2023 course from Zero To Mastery(ZTM). It was my introduction into the environment of React through the installation of Node.Js.

Challenges:
-Being able to understand where each function that we create should be placed. Either the paremeter at the beginning, or later in the function
-First time using react.js. 
  -components
  -objects
  -set up
 -First set with using 'npm' commands
 
 
 Benefits:
 -Pushed my error debugging. 
 -Simple project to understand the implementation of react.
 -Better practice with DOM manipulation/events.
 -First use of tachyons
  -Thus having cleaner code and less clumped up css files. 
  -Using a json placeholder for the first time. 
  -Introduction into 'fetch', 'this', 'constructer+super' in a real project example
 
UPDATE(22.02.2023): The page is not loading the content. I will look into this as soon as possible. There is a fork of the project from ZTM with a live website on how it looks if not yet resolved.
